    <h2>WHEN YOU PLANT TREES</h2>
    <h3>You're protecting the planet</h3>
    <p>
      The Forest Garden Approach restores degraded land, captures carbon,
      improves biodiversity, and prevents future unsustainable land use
      practices.

    <h3>You're ending hunger</h3>
    <p>
      The average Forest Garden is home to dozens of food crops, providing
      access to diverse, nutrient-rich meals year round.

    <h3>You're empowering women</h3>
    <p>
      Farmer groups in our program are required to be composed of at least 35%
      women. Most exceed that benchmark, with many led by women farmers.
