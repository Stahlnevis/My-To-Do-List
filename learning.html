      Recent genomic studies involving the four extant junglefowl species
      reveals that the domestication of chicken, the most populous poultry
      species, occurred around 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. This was
      previously believed to have occurred around 5,400 years ago, also in
      Southeast Asia.
