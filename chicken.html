      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged
      bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000
      years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
      others are kept as pets or for cockfighting. Chickens are common and
      widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
      2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred
      for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural
      references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are relativ√∂ely large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">birds</a>, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered, and the wings are short.<sup>[17]</sup> Wild junglefowl can
      fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly
      more than a short distance.

    <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen.<sup>[31]</sup>The dance triggers a response in the hen[31] and when she
      responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
      mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches
      the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive,
      she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with
      both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending
      display.
